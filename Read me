- The html file includes a link to the custom font used from google fonts, 
 a link for viewing compatibility of devices and a link for the latest version of jQuery
- jQuery was used for DOM manipulation
- The grid has a CSS animation to make it rotate when clicking the play button
- The landing page has an animation so it slides down when loading the page
- Each level increases the amount of cells flashed by one and it is automatic

Issues left to correct:

- The amount of cells flashed sometimes is off by one or two which might be an issue with the Math.random() giving 
  identical random numbers refering to the same cell
- The game over message sometimes is displayed innacurately
- The successfull level completion message sometimes is displayed innacurately
- The grid does not rotate again after passing the first level
